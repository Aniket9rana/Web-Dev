To start our slow increase in community engagement, we want to tease you about our upcoming mobile app and increased activity. Since this has been a 100 % passion-driven project since 2011 we will now create an ad-free mobile app you can download for a small fee due to large demand from our users. This will not only ensure the existence of the service, but it will give us some innovation bandwidth to start providing more features to all of you.

Our hope is to create a better environment for you to interact with each other and us at Spotalike regarding music inspiration in general and our service. And hopefully through our channels you might just spot-a-like-minded in there. :)

Hence we are now opening up for reactions to this and feel free to comment about your thoughts and ideas!

Stay tuned!

/Your friends in the Spotalike team
